Despite being a relatively new country, having gained independence just over a decade ago, Snailand has quickly established itself as a major player in the international market.\n",

            "According to the latest reports, Snailand's GDP has been steadily increasing over the past few years, with a projected growth rate of 4% for the current year. This is largely due to the country's thriving tourism industry, which has seen a significant increase in visitors drawn to the country's pristine beaches and vibrant culture.\n",
            "\n",
            "In addition to its tourism sector, Snailand has also seen growth in its agriculture and manufacturing industries. The country's fertile soil and favorable climate have made it an ideal location for farming, with crops such as sugarcane, coffee, and citrus fruits being major exports. Meanwhile, the government's efforts to attract foreign investment have led to the establishment of several manufacturing facilities, creating jobs and generating revenue for the country.\n",
            "\n",
            "One of the key factors driving Snailand's economic growth is its strategic location in the heart of the Pacific. The country's proximity to major shipping lanes and its well-developed port infrastructure have made it an attractive destination for international trade. In fact, Snalandian officials have announced plans to further develop the country's ports and transportation networks, with the goal of becoming a major hub for global commerce.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, despite its many successes, Snailand is not without its challenges. The country faces stiff competition from neighboring nations, particularly in the tourism sector, where other countries have long-established reputations and infrastructure. Additionally, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the country's economy, with many businesses forced to shut down or scale back operations.\n",
            "\n",
            "Despite these challenges, Snailand's government remains optimistic about the country's future. In a recent statement, the Minister of Finance emphasized the country's commitment to sustainable economic growth and development, saying, \"We are confident that with the right policies and investments, Snailand will continue to thrive and become an even more important player in the global economy.\"\n",

While challenges remain, the country's strategic location and commitment to sustainable growth bode well for its future prospects. As the world watches with interest, Snailand is sure to continue making waves in the global economy for years to come.\n"

        "sentences = ['London: World oil prices sank Friday after the International Energy Agency warned over the price outlook amid bulging global supplies.In midday London deals, European benchmark Brent North Sea crude for April delivery fell 57 cents to $56.51 a barrel.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for April shed 72 cents to $46.33 a barrel.\"Crude oil prices extended losses ... as investors remained cautious following the bearish IEA oil monthly report, high levels of crude oil inventories and the strong US dollar rally,\" said Sucden analyst Myrto Sokou.The Paris-based IEA energy watchdog warned Friday that the recent rebound in oil prices was built on flimsy foundations.Prices collapsed by 60 percent to about $40 between June and late January due to global oil oversupply, a weak world economy and the strong dollar.However, the market has since rebounded somewhat following a slowdown in US oil-drilling activities.\"Behind the facade of stability, the rebalancing triggered by the price collapse has yet to run its course, and it might be overly optimistic to expect it to proceed smoothly,\" said the Paris-based IEA, which advises energy consuming nations.It noted that a key driver in the recovery in oil prices has been drops in the number of rigs drilling for shale oil in the United States.\"Yet US supply so far shows precious little sign of slowing down. Quite to the contrary, it continues to defy expectations,\" said the IEA in its monthly report, which sharply revised up output estimates for the end of last year and forecasts for the start of 2015.The IEA hiked its demand forecasts for every quarter this year, with the annual 2015 figure bumped up by 100,000 barrels per day to 93.5 mbpd, compared with its previous forecast given last month.In earlier Asian trading, the oil market had risen on news of a deal to end a strike at US refineries.Crude futures had fallen Thursday after a government report showed surging US stockpiles, adding to a global oversupply.The US Department of Energy on Wednesday said inventories hit a fresh record high of 448.9 million barrels last week, while stockpiles at the Cushing terminal hub in Oklahoma -- the price settlement point for WTI -- also increased.Bloomberg News meanwhile reported the United Steelworkers union representing 30,000 US oil workers had reached a tentative deal on a four-year contract with Royal Dutch Shell that could see a mass walkout brought to a close.Another development affecting the market was an announcement on Monday by the US Energy Information Administration raising its crude production forecast this year to 9.35 million barrels per day from 9.30 million.

            "1) (0.85) New York: Oil prices fell Tuesday as the Saudi-led coalition announced an end to its military strikes in Yemen and the market expected another rise in US crude inventories. West Texas Intermediate for May delivery sank $1.12, or two percent, to close at $55.26 a barrel on its last day the contract´s trade on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Brent North Sea crude for June delivery, the global benchmark, settled at $62.08 a barrel in London trade, down $1.37 (2.2 percent) from Monday´s closing level.News of the Saudi-led coalition wrapping up air strikes against rebels in Yemen, coming in afternoon trade in New York, accelerated losses on the market, said Phil Flynn of Price Futures Group.\"Oil is selling because the Saudis are going to end their operation in Yemen,\" Flynn said. \"This is why we´ve seen the precipitous drop in prices in the last few minutes.\"The end of four weeks of air strikes against the Huthi rebel forces, with the coalition saying the rebels´ threat to Saudi Arabia and neighboring countries had been removed, eased concerns about the spreading unrest in Yemen.Although Yemen is not a particularly important oil producer, market watchers have been worried about the impact of the turmoil on the oil-rich region, notably in Iran, which is suspected of supporting the rebellion.Expectations for Wednesday´s weekly inventories report from the US Department of Energy were bearish. The country´s historically high crude inventories were estimated to have increased by 2.5 million barrels in the week ended April 17, according to a Bloomberg News survey of experts.Oil prices have shed about half their value since last June amid a supply glut and weak demand growth.For many analysts, recent gains in oil prices were mainly the result of speculative buying by investors betting that the fundamentals of supply and demand would improve. News last week of a slight decline in US oil production had boosted prices.\"There is no fundamental explanation for the price spike,\" Commerzbank analysts said in a research note Tuesday. \"Due to sharply higher OPEC oil production, the market remains significantly oversupplied.\" (AFP)\n",
            "2) (0.80) London: Oil prices fell Friday after spiking the previous day as Saudi Arabian jets struck rebel targets in Yemen, sparking supply fears in the crude-rich Middle East.Brent North Sea crude for delivery in May sank 63 cents to $58.56 a barrel in London midday deals.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for May slid 81 cents to $50.62 a barrel.\"Oil prices ... are shedding some of the strong gains they had achieved over the two previous days,\" said Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch.\"It would appear that the initial panicky response to Saudi Arabia´s military intervention in Yemen is giving way to a more sober assessment of the situation.\"Prices rose sharply on Wednesday and Thursday after a Saudi Arabia-led coalition bombed Huthi rebels in support of Yemen´s embattled President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi.WTI struck a one-month high of $52.48 and Brent jumped to a March 9 peak of $59.78 on Thursday.However, the market has since pulled lower owing to no disruption to oil supplies.Yemen is bordered by key Middle East oil producers Saudi Arabia and Oman.\"Oil prices have cooled ... as the initial panic over the consequences of Saudi Arabia´s military action in Yemen and the harm it might cause its oil distribution have failed to materialise,\" added analyst Alistair McCaig at traders IG.Yemen has been gripped by turmoil since the rebels launched a power takeover in Sanaa in February.Warplanes from the Saudi-led coalition kept up raids against Huthi rebels on Friday as Hadi headed to an Arab summit to garner support as Iran warned the intervention was \"dangerous\".\"The recent developments in Yemen have caused oil prices to jump on fears of disruption to supplies,\" said research house Capital Economics in a commentary.There are concerns that an escalation of the conflict could disrupt oil shipments passing through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, located between Yemen and Djibouti and through which about 3.8 million barrels of oil per day are transported, it added.Other analysts said the impact of the Yemen crisis on the market was tempered by the crude oversupply, which has been fanned by record US stockpiles and the OPEC cartel´s refusal to slash production.\"Despite all this increase, we continue to see weak oil fundamentals and thus, find it extremely hard for current prices to persist,\" said Daniel Ang, an investment analyst with Phillip Futures in Singapore. (AFP)\n",
            "3) (0.71) strong>NEW YORK: Oil prices rose sharply on Thursday after Saudi Arabia´s energy minister said producers may take action to help rebalance global oil markets.</strongThe remarks helped send prices up more than 4 percent in New York, where a barrel of West Texas Intermediate for September delivery closed up $1.78 at $43.49, after having lost more than a dollar the day before.In London, North Sea Brent for October delivery rose $1.99 to $46.04 a barrel on the Intercontinental Exchange.<br/>Matt Smith of ClipperData said the whipsawing of prices was \"crazy.\"Smith said oil prices had dropped Wednesday after Saudi oil production figures showed the country´s output had risen last month to nearly 11 million barrels per day.But in remarks reported Thursday, Saudi oil minister Khalid al-Falih said an informal meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) scheduled for next month would be the occasion for producers to discuss \"any possible action.\"Saudi Arabia´s offer to take action was \"completely at odds with this production data,\" Smith told AFP.<br/>James Williams of WTRG Economics said markets were in an \"ongoing battle.\"\"It´s between reality and possibilities, if you will,\" he told AFP. \"The reality is the market continues to be oversupplied, with (a) really big increase in Saudi output last month.\"\n",
            "4) (0.69) strong>RIYADH: Saudi Arabia plans to sell up to 49 percent of its oil giant Saudi Aramco within 10 years as the world´s largest crude exporter tries to lower its deficit, local media said Saturday.</strongThe Al-Eqtisadiah daily quoted an unnamed official as saying the sale would raise funds to be spent \"at home and abroad\" in what is expected to form the world´s largest state investment fund.The kingdom is looking to diversify its oil-dependent economy and has already announced cutbacks after its 2015 deficit snowballed to $97 billion (93 billion euros).The IPO for state-owned Aramco could take place in 2018 and an initial sale of a five percent share is expected to form the basis for the fund holding around $2 trillion in assets.The firm will next year begin publishing quarterly results in a bid to attract potential investors, Aramco chief Amin Nasser has said.Riyadh earlier this month agreed to slash its oil production beyond cuts agreed among OPEC members, giving crude prices a lift. They remain at around half of their mid-2014 levels.\n",
            "5) (0.67) strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices dipped in early Asian trading on Tuesday on signs that production in the Middle East is continuing to rise, countering falls in U.S. output and threatening to keep a global supply overhang in place for longer.</strongThe international Brent crude benchmark was trading at $45.68 per barrel at 0100 GMT, down 15 cents from its last close.U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 6 cents at $44.72 a barrel.The dips came as Iraq, the second biggest exporter within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was the latest OPEC-member to announce its exports were rising, reporting oil shipments from southern fields at an average rate of 3.364 million barrels per day (bpd) in April.That was higher than the March average of 3.286 million and close to its November record of 3.37 million bpd.\"Energy was weaker. Concerns over rising OPEC supply were raised after Iraq announced it had shipped 3.36 million bpd in April,\" ANZ bank said on Tuesday.Production in OPEC´s biggest exporter, Saudi Arabia, was 10.15 million bpd in April, but sources have said it may rise to near-records of 10.5 million bpd in coming weeks.Adding to surging Middle East output is Iran which, relieved of crippling sanctions in January, has increased its exports to almost 2 million bpd currently from little over 1 million bpd at the start of the year, with sales especially to South Korea soaring.The surging supplies from the Middle East counter falling U.S. output, where production has declined from a peak of around 9.6 million bpd in June 2015, to below 9 million bpd now, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data.\"It was the falling U.S. production that helped lift prices earlier this year, so if a surge in Middle East output now counters the U.S. decline, then we could well be in for another downward correction in oil markets,\" one trader said.Crude futures surged by almost a third in April, and they have recovered over 70 percent from decade lows reached in early 2016.\"A weaker dollar, falling U.S. oil production, improving economic data from China, combined with large speculative positions fuelled the rally.Analysts, however, have cautioned that inventories remain high and oversupply persists,\" Singapore Exchange (SGX) said on Tuesday in its monthly report.\n",
            "6) (0.67) LONDON: Oil prices rose Tuesday as markets weighed the effects of Iran´s deal with six world powers on curbing the Islamic republic´s suspected ambitions for a nuclear bomb.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for August delivery gained 84 cents at $53.04 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.European benchmark Brent oil for August delivery added 66 cents at $58.51 a barrel in London. \"I think people had already sold down the price of oil, expecting an agreement,\" said Michael Lynch, an analyst with the US-based consultancy Strategic Energy & Economic Research. \"So it´s a case of selling on the rumour and buying on the news.\"\"Now that it´s actually happened, people are buying back in,\" Lynch said.Analysts said the landmark agreement that will see sanctions eventually lifted on Iran´s oil exports would help to put a lid on any rise in crude futures this year and in the future.\"To be clear, the return of Iranian oil exports over the next year is one factor likely to keep oil prices low,\" said Thomas Pugh, commodities economist at consultants Capital Economics.Historic dealMajor powers -- Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States -- clinched a historic deal Tuesday aimed at ensuring Iran does not obtain the nuclear bomb, opening up Tehran´s stricken economy and potentially ending decades of bad blood with the West.Reached on day 18 of marathon talks in Vienna, the accord is aimed at resolving a 13-year standoff over Iran´s nuclear ambitions after repeated diplomatic failures and threats of military action.The deal puts strict limits on Iran´s nuclear activities for at least a decade and calls for stringent UN oversight, with world powers hoping that this will make any dash to make an atomic bomb virtually impossible.In return, painful international sanctions that have slashed the oil exports of OPEC´s fifth-largest producer and choked its economy will be lifted and billions of dollars in frozen assets unblocked.However, analysts cautioned that it will take time for additional Iranian oil to hit markets.\"Iranian crude oil production is likely to increase in 2016 but will take a number of years to reach its previous peak,\" Fitch Ratings said in a client note on Tuesday.\"Iran´s oil exports at the moment are around 1.1 million barrels per day versus levels of around 2.5 million before 2012,\" it noted.The ratings agency added: \"We would expect to see some increases in production throughout the course of 2016 but that this would be less than half of the full 1.4 million barrels daily that was lost.\"The remainder will require significant investment and expertise, for which Iran is likely to want to partner with international oil companies.\"A spokesperson for Royal Dutch Shell said the energy giant is \"interested in exploring the role Shell can play in developing Iran´s energy potential\".BP added in a statement: \"We are watching the situation and in the meantime we continue to comply with sanctions. We will look at opportunities once able to do so.\"Lid on pricesLooking ahead, \"the extent of the impact on oil prices will depend primarily on the domestic capability to get oil on the market\", said Nina Skero, economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research.\"We expect Brent crude to... trade around $60 per barrel for the remainder of the year,\" she added.World oil prices collapsed by 60 per cent between June 2014 and January when it hit a low of $45. This in part was owing to excessive supplies caused by the boom in US shale oil.While OPEC on Monday revised upward its forecast for global crude oil demand growth for this year, it warned that crude output would also continue to increase.Iran´s OPEC peers Saudi Arabia and Iraq \"have both significantly ramped up production this year\", noted Richard Mallinson, analyst at research group Energy Aspects.\"There is little chance that these countries, and other OPEC members, are going to reduce output to make space for a return of Iranian production,\" he told AFP.\n",
            "7) (0.66) strong>LONDON: Oil edged above $50 a barrel on Thursday, drawing support from sources' comments that OPEC's Gulf members are willing to cut their output by 4 percent and from a further drop in U.S. crude inventories.</strongSaudi Arabia and its Gulf OPEC allies are willing to make that reduction from their peak oil output, energy ministers from the Gulf countries told their Russian counterpart this week, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.\"That seems to be the reason behind the price move,\" said Carsten Fritsch, analyst at Commerzbank. \"But the big question is, how will they handle Iraq.\"Brent crude was up 38 cents at $50.36 a barrel as of 1348 GMT, having risen as high as $50.67 intra-day. U.S. crude gained 28 cents to $49.46.Oil also drew support from the unexpected drop in U.S. crude inventories, and larger than expected falls in stocks of gasoline and distillates, reported this week, which raised hopes that a long-awaited market rebalancing is finally under way.\"The global stock overhang must be reduced in order to see higher prices. Whilst such reduction is largely in the hand of OPEC, the re-balancing is already taking place in the U.S.,\" Tamas Varga of oil broker PVM said.The market was keeping an eye on escalating protests in Venezuela against the rule of President Nicolas Maduro, although there was no sign of any impact on the OPEC member's oil output. Venezuelan production has been falling this year as low prices hit investment.Doubts about the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' supply cut deal have been weighing on the market this week.OPEC agreed last month its first deal to restrain output in eight years to boost prices. But Iraq on Sunday called for Baghdad to be exempt, adding to the list of members seeking special treatment.A technical meeting at OPEC's headquarters on Friday, and with officials from non-OPEC countries on Saturday, is supposed to come up with recommendations on how to implement the supply cutback to the oil ministers' next meeting on Nov. 30.The OPEC plan is designed to speed up the removal of a supply glut that is keeping oil prices at less than half their level of mid-2014, cutting exporters' income and leading to investment cuts by oil companies worldwide.\n",

            "10) (0.65) NEW YORK: US oil prices Monday slipped below $50 a barrel for the first time in more than five years as the surging dollar and news of additional supplies extended a six-month rout.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for February delivery, in free fall since June, ended at $50.04 a barrel, down $2.65 or five percent. The contract got as low as $49.95 a barrel earlier in the session, its lowest level since May 1, 2009.European benchmark Brent oil for February delivery fell $3.31 to $53.11 a barrel in London.Monday´s slide in oil prices followed indications of rising output from key producers Russia and Iraq at a time when forecasters have trimmed their demand projections due to weak global economic growth.The breaching of the psychologically important $50 level also came on a turbulent day for global financial markets. US stocks fell nearly two percent, approaching the drops in European equity markets as the euro plunged to a nine-year low on revived eurozone worries.A long rally in the greenback, which gained 11 percent last year against a basket of major currencies, has weighed on the dollar-priced oil market by making crude more expensive for buyers using weaker currencies.Oil prices could fall further still, analysts say.\"There´s serious concern the bottom´s not in yet,\" said Kyle Cooper, managing partner at IAF Advisors in Houston. \"Basically everyone who´s taken a stab at the bottom has been wrong.\"\"Oil prices attempted to stabilize during the last two weeks, but the fundamentals remain weak,\" said Gene McGillian, broker and analyst at Tradition Energy. \"The market is trying to come to a bottom. It could be anybody´s guess, but it appears we still have more to go.\"Fawad Razaqzada, a technical analyst at Forex.com., said the drop below $50 a barrel could trigger more selling, paving the way for oil to fall as low as $45 or $40 a barrel in the coming weeks.-Weak fundamentals-The retreat in prices comes on the heels of a multi-year boom in US oil production that has shaken the global petroleum market and put the US in a league with oil giants Russia and Saudi Arabia.Other leading producers are also pumping aggressively. Iraq´s oil ministry last week released figures showing that December crude exports reached their highest since 1980.Meanwhile, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has consistently ruled out action despite the months-long slide in prices.In November, the cartel met in Vienna and took no action, as key powerbrokers like Saudi Arabian oil minister Ali al-Naimi said he preferred for the market to balance itself. In December, Naimi told a Middle East publication the group would take the same hands-off approach even if oil fell to $20 a barrel.Meanwhile, economic growth remains uncertain in Europe and in many emerging economies, such as China and Brazil. The International Energy Agency in December projected global crude inventories could rise by nearly 300 million barrels in the first six months of 2015. The agency also cut its demand outlook by more than 200,000 barrels a day for 2015.Energy equities, by far the worst performing sector in the S&P 500 last year, suffered more pain Monday. Dow member Chevron fell 4.0 percent, while oil-services giant Schlumberger lost 2.6 percent.Key US oil companies like ConocoPhillips and shale producer Continental Resources have cut their drilling budgets for 2015.Still, analysts expect US output to continue to rise this year, owing to investments that have already been made. That will put more pressure on crude prices.\"I still think one of the primary drivers of the market is US oil production and I really don´t see US oil production growth slowing appreciably in the first quarter,\" Cooper said.

              "'Date: 8/18/2015\\nHeading: buzzfeed gets 200m expansion cash with nbcuniversal tie u\\nNews Type: business\\n\\nWASHINGTON: BuzzFeed, the website which lives off viral and \"shareable\" news, got a major boost for expansion plans Tuesday with a $200 million investment from NBCUniversal.The deal with NBCU, a division of the media and cable conglomerate Comcast, calls for \"strategic partnerships\" between the two groups, which could allow sharing of content between BuzzFeed and the vast NBC television operations.The deal values the \"social news\" pioneer at some $1.5 billion, according to several media reports. The companies did not comment on the valuation terms of the investment.\"It´s a fascinating time for the media industry; social, mobile, digital, and broadcast platforms are converging to create new opportunities to connect with global audiences,\" said Jonah Peretti, BuzzFeed´s founder and chief executive.The news comes just a week after NBCUniversal announced a similar $200 million injection into another digital news group, Vox Media, and highlights the potential seen in online news as consumers move away from traditional media.\"BuzzFeed has built an exceptional global company that harmonizes technology, data and superior editorial abilities to create and share content in innovative ways,\" said Steve Burke, CEO at NBCUniversal.\"They reach a massive, loyal audience and have proven to be among the most creative, popular and influential new media players. We are pleased to be making this investment and for our companies to partner and work together.\"The investment follows Monday´s announcement that BuzzFeed would launch a Japanese news website in a partnership with Yahoo Japan, the latest step in a global expansion push.BuzzFeed is one of the largest pure-play digital websites, claiming to reach some 200 million users worldwide.With its recent expansion, the group says some 45 percent of traffic now comes from outside the United States, having launched editions in Britain, Brazil, France, Australia, India, Germany, Mexico and Canada.BuzzFeed, founded in 2006 by Huffington Post co-founder Peretti, was known for offbeat \"shareable\" news but has been investing in new staff and technology as it expands globally.NBCU was created as a joint venture with the NBC broadcast group and Universal Pictures, previously controlled by France´s Vivendi. Comcast took full control of NBCU in 2013.- Profiting from sharing -While BuzzFeed´s finances are not made public, documents leaked last week by the website Gawker suggested it is making a profit -- some $2.7 million in the first six months of 2014 and $7 million in 2013.Rebecca Lieb, an independent media consultant and analyst, said BuzzFeed \"has successfully captured mass eyeballs, which is difficult in an era of highly specialised and topical information.\"BuzzFeed \"is good at picking topics which are light and entertaining and shareable,\" Lieb told AFP.Additionally, she said BuzzFeed has successfully reached younger audiences who often don´t read newspapers or subscribe to cable television, and that this group is attractive to advertisers.BuzzFeed also has been able to optimise its content by using algorithms that show which stories are viewed and shared most often, and prioritising these items, Lieb said.She added that the website is strong in \"native\" advertising, which includes \"sponsored\" and similar content.The tie-up with NBCU offers potential, Lieb said, such as snippets of Olympic videos which could be offered to BuzzFeed and drive consumers to watch more on television.Kenneth Lerer, BuzzFeed´s executive chairman, said in a statement that the tie-up could mean \"collaborating on television content, movies, the Olympics, and joint partnerships with ad agencies and brands.\"Last year, BuzzFeed said it had secured $50 million in a deal that reportedly valued it at $850 million. But the latest injection vaults it into the club of \"unicorns,\" a term used for startups valued at over $1 billion.Vox is believed to be worth over $1 billion following its recent cash infusion from NBCU. And Vice Media last year secured some $500 million which boosted its valuation to a reported $2.5 billion.One of the largest digital-only news groups is the Huffington Post, whose future is uncertain after its parent company AOL was sold this year to telecom giant Verizon.'"

            "London: World oil prices sank Friday after the International Energy Agency warned over the price outlook amid bulging global supplies.In midday London deals, European benchmark Brent North Sea crude for April delivery fell 57 cents to $56.51 a barrel.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for April shed 72 cents to $46.33 a barrel.\"Crude oil prices extended losses ... as investors remained cautious following the bearish IEA oil monthly report, high levels of crude oil inventories and the strong US dollar rally,\" said Sucden analyst Myrto Sokou.The Paris-based IEA energy watchdog warned Friday that the recent rebound in oil prices was built on flimsy foundations.Prices collapsed by 60 percent to about $40 between June and late January due to global oil oversupply, a weak world economy and the strong dollar.However, the market has since rebounded somewhat following a slowdown in US oil-drilling activities.\"Behind the facade of stability, the rebalancing triggered by the price collapse has yet to run its course, and it might be overly optimistic to expect it to proceed smoothly,\" said the Paris-based IEA, which advises energy consuming nations.It noted that a key driver in the recovery in oil prices has been drops in the number of rigs drilling for shale oil in the United States.\"Yet US supply so far shows precious little sign of slowing down. Quite to the contrary, it continues to defy expectations,\" said the IEA in its monthly report, which sharply revised up output estimates for the end of last year and forecasts for the start of 2015.The IEA hiked its demand forecasts for every quarter this year, with the annual 2015 figure bumped up by 100,000 barrels per day to 93.5 mbpd, compared with its previous forecast given last month.In earlier Asian trading, the oil market had risen on news of a deal to end a strike at US refineries.Crude futures had fallen Thursday after a government report showed surging US stockpiles, adding to a global oversupply.The US Department of Energy on Wednesday said inventories hit a fresh record high of 448.9 million barrels last week, while stockpiles at the Cushing terminal hub in Oklahoma -- the price settlement point for WTI -- also increased.Bloomberg News meanwhile reported the United Steelworkers union representing 30,000 US oil workers had reached a tentative deal on a four-year contract with Royal Dutch Shell that could see a mass walkout brought to a close.Another development affecting the market was an announcement on Monday by the US Energy Information Administration raising its crude production forecast this year to 9.35 million barrels per day from 9.30 million.

            "strong>DUBAI: The International Monetary Fund backed Saudi Arabia's sweeping economic reform plan on Thursday and said the kingdom was cutting spending at the right speed to cope with a huge state budget deficit caused by low oil prices.</strongLate last month, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced steps to reduce the kingdom's dependence on oil exports over the next 15 years, including subsidy cuts, tax rises, sales of state assets, a government efficiency drive and efforts to spur private sector investment.The IMF had for years been urging Saudi Arabia to adopt many of those measures, and in a statement on Thursday it said the reform plan aimed for \"an appropriately bold and far-reaching transformation of the Saudi Arabian economy\".\"The supporting policies that will be announced in the coming months are expected to set out how these goals will be achieved,\" IMF official Tim Callen said after leading a team to Saudi Arabia this month for annual consultations with the Fund.\"To ensure their success, the reforms will need to be properly prioritized and sequenced, and the appropriate pace of implementation carefully assessed.\"Riyadh has been cutting spending and trying to raise fresh revenues as it grapples with its budget deficit, which totaled $98 billion in 2015. The IMF predicted the deficit would stay very large this year, at about 14 percent of gross domestic product compared to 16 percent last year.But it welcomed the government's spending controls and changes to domestic energy prices announced last December, saying: \"Fiscal policy is appropriately adjusting to the drop in oil prices.\" The economy is expected to grow 1.2 percent this year, slowing from 3.5 percent in 2015, the Fund said.strong>DEFICIT FINANCING</strongThe IMF also said it approved of the way in which the government was financing its deficit with a combination of drawing down its financial reserves and issuing debt at home and abroad.The Fund has been encouraging some North African states to make their foreign exchange rates more flexible to cope with big current account deficits. But it took the opposite tack toward the external deficit which Saudi Arabia is running because of cheap oil, saying the riyal's peg to the U.S. dollar was continuing to serve the economy well.Market interest rates in Saudi Arabia have been rising sharply as the government borrows from banks to finance its deficit, with the three-month Saudi interbank offered rate SASAR3MD= jumping 135 basis points since mid-2015 to a multi-year high of 2.13 percent.But the IMF said the Saudi banking sector was strong and well-positioned to weather a slowing economy, and that tightening liquidity was not yet hurting credit growth.Two cornerstones of the Saudi reform plan are the sale of a stake of up to 5 percent in national oil giant Saudi Aramco, which could fetch tens of billions of dollars, and a build-up of the government's Public Investment Fund into a global investment vehicle.The IMF urged Riyadh to make both institutions more transparent and to integrate them into a new fiscal policy apparatus which the government is creating to make spending decisions more efficient.\n",
